/// ## Design Motivation
/// - **Name**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_(astronomy)
///     It is made clear that other variants are `gravitational primary`,
///     `primary body` or `central body` however, the `primary` classification
///     provides a better categorisation when dealing with multi hierarchical
///     systems (i.e. Solar System Barycentric (primary),
///     Mars Barycentric (secondary), {Mars, Phobos, Deimos} (tertiaries).
///     This naming scheme will then make the distinction clear when dealing
///     with and designing celestial systems. This requires more development
///     however. This scheme is relational, not absolute in nature.
/// ## Contained structs
/// - GM(f64):
///     * Allows for state conversions (e.g. CartesianCoordinates <-> KeplerianElements)
/// - FrameGM(Frame, f64):
///     * Allows for state conversions (e.g. CartesianCoordinates <-> KeplerianElements)
///     * Allows for frame transformations that differ by Z-rotation (e.g. J2000 <-> J1900)
/// - CelestialBody:
///     * Allows for state conversions (e.g. CartesianCoordinates <-> KeplerianElements)
///     * Allows for frame transformations that differ by Z-rotation (e.g. J2000 <-> J1900)
///     * Allows for frame transformations that differ by plane (within attainable accuracy) (Ecliptic <-> Equatorial)
